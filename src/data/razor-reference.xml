	<description>
		<p>
			This is a quick reference for the various properties and functions available
			when developing Razor Views for <a href="https://umbraco.com/" target="_blank">Umbraco</a>.
			A very good way to use this, is to
			<a href="https://kapeli.com/dash/" target="_blank">get the Dash app</a> and add this as a
			docset (using the Dash Feed link below).
		</p>
		<p>
			Every property/function can be linked to directly, as they're just anchorlinks, which is
			super-handy when trying to explain something on
			<a href="https://our.umbraco.org/forum/" target="_blank">a forum</a> or similar&#8230;

# Umbraco Razor Quick Reference

This is a quick reference/cheatsheet for use when writing Razor views/partials
for [Umbraco][UMB]

There's two main purposes for this:

1. For use with [Dash][DASH] on macOS - it's the perfect app for all sorts of API/reference lookups
2. To serve as a [reference section][UMBRAZREF] on a website so you can easily point people to a URL that explains a specific method.

Feel free to use the [issue tracker][ISSUES] or perhaps even fork the repo and submit pull requests for discussion, if you see anything that's missing.

## Credits

* Uses [@LeaVerou][LEA]'s awesome [Prism][PRISM] for syntax-highlighting any code samples

## DEV Notes

I use [CodeKit][CK] for preprocessing the LESS file (enabling autoprefixer), and a bash script to transform the XML file with the list of methods into a single HTML file. Yay, XSLT!
